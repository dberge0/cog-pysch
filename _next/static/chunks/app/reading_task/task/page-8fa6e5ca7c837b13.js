And then, as I sit there helplessly, they chew a hole in my screen, say ‘sayonara, sucker’ and make my computer spark, smoke, and then explode.” Jeffries added that it made sense why he was constantly getting hacked, as he still thought the only way to protect his computer was to upload his consciousness to his computer via floppy disk and personally kill the worm."})})})})]})})}},9036:function(e,t,s){"use strict";var n=s(7437),r=s(2265);t.Z=()=>{let[e,t]=(0,r.useState)(30);return(0,r.useEffect)(()=>{if(0===e)return;let s=setInterval(()=>{t(e-1)},1e3);return()=>clearInterval(s)},[e]),(0,n.jsx)("div",{className:"fixed top-0 right-0 m-4",children:(0,n.jsx)("div",{className:"text-right",children:(0,n.jsxs)("span",{className:"text-lg font-semibold",children:[e," seconds"]})})})}}},function(e){e.O(0,[971,69,744],function(){return e(e.s=122)}),_N_E=e.O()}]);
