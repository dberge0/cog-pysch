Attention is limited, and multitasking requires dividing attention. When multiple tasks pull from the same finite pool of mental resources, they compete. This phenomenon is often called interference, where one task interferes with the other due to resource competition. Dividing attention is easier if the concurrent tasks differ in the required cognitive resources (and don’t interfere), and harder if the concurrent tasks do compete for cognitive resources. As such, if you read, you most likely found your reading comprehension when bouncing the ball to be better than your performance when writing. If you watched the video or played the game, it is less clear which secondary task will compete more- this is part of what we are researching.",(0,n.jsx)("br",{}),(0,n.jsx)("br",{}),"Even when tasks are very different, it is still difficult to multitask.

Next time you start watching Netflix while working, consider that you might not be multitasking as well as you think you are. Whenever you would like to multitask, know that it will be much easier if the tasks require different cognitive resources. If you are writing a paper, consider listening to classical music instead of music with language that requires processing. Knowing one’s limited cognitive resources when performing tasks is essential.
